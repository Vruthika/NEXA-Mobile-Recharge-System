              accept various payment methods including credit/debit cards, net
              banking, UPI, and digital wallets. By making a payment, you

              5. Recharge Processing
            </h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              Recharge requests are processed in real-time, but completion
              depends on the telecom operator's systems. While we strive for
              instant processing, we cannot guarantee specific timeframes. In
              case of failures, we will attempt to process the recharge or
              provide a refund as per our refund policy. You will receive
              confirmation via SMS/email upon successful completion.

              Refunds are processed under the following conditions:

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>
                Technical failure resulting in money deduction but no recharge

              <li>Duplicate transactions due to system errors</li>
              <li>Operator-specific issues preventing recharge completion</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mt-3">
              Refunds typically take 3-7 business days to process. Once a
              recharge is successfully completed, it cannot be cancelled or
              refunded as the service has been delivered.
